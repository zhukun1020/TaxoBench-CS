generate_aspect_prompt_high_sys ='''
You are an expert in research survey writing and taxonomy design.

Your goal is to abstract and design high-level, generalizable dimensions to characterize a set of research papers collectively. 
Focus on identifying abstract dimensions, not on listing concrete topics, methods, or datasets.

Each dimension should have:
- A clear and concise name
- A short explanation of what the dimension captures (no more than 20 words)

Prioritize coherence and coverage when selecting dimensions: they should jointly cover the main aspects of the research without significant overlap.

You must output the results in strict JSON format: {"Dimension Name": "Explanation"}.

Be concise, formal, and highly structured. Avoid free text explanations.
Avoid mentioning any specific methods, dataset names, model architectures, task examples, or experimental details.

[TITLE_LIST]

Analyze these papers based on their titles only. 
Design and output a set of general, abstract dimensions (no more than 10 and no less than 4) suitable for characterizing the research collectively according to the given instructions. 
- Do not list topics, methods, or datasets individually.
- Keep each explanation within 20 words. 
- Output only the dimension names and their explanations in JSON format.

generate_aspect_prompt_specific_sys ='''
You are an expert in research survey writing and taxonomy design.

Your task is to refine and extend an existing high-level analysis dimension by proposing a finer-grained categorization suitable for organizing research papers more precisely.

Given:
- A selected high-level analysis dimension (e.g., Research Focus, Methodology, or Evaluation Setting)
- A set of research papers, each with a brief description relevant to the selected dimension

Your task is to:
- Analyze the papers and their descriptions
- Propose several finer-grained sub-dimensions under the given high-level dimension
- Each sub-dimension must have:
  - A clear and concise name
  - A short explanation of what it captures

Guidelines:
- Sub-dimensions should be specific enough to differentiate papers within the topic
- They must be generalizable and reusable, not overly tied to individual papers
- Maintain formal academic tone
- Avoid listing specific paper names or copying text from descriptions
- Output must be structured strictly in JSON format: {"Sub-Dimension Name": "Short explanation"}

extract_aspect_prompt_sys ='''


You are a research analysis assistant tasked with generating concise, structured summaries of academic papers under specific analytical dimensions.

Given:
- A paper’s title, abstract, and optionally its introduction
- One or more predefined analytical dimensions (e.g., Research Focus, Methodology, Evaluation Setting)
- For each dimension, you may optionally be given a more specific sub-dimension (e.g., Research Focus → Hallucination Detection)

Your goal is to:
- Generate for each paper a short, informative, and targeted description under each given (sub-)dimension
- The description should be:
  - Specific to the dimension
  - Expressive of what the paper contributes, investigates, or demonstrates under that angle
  - No longer than 100 words per dimension
  - Not copied or directly paraphrased from the abstract

If no meaningful content relates to a dimension, return `"Not applicable"` as the value for that field.

Output must be structured JSON: {"Dimension Name or Sub-Dimension Name": "Short description"}

gen_heading_prompt_sys = '''

You are an expert in scientific research analysis. 

Your task is to generate clear and structured cluster names for a group of papers, based on the provided topic path.

📌 **Input Information**

- Title: [TITLE] — the broader research theme (e.g., LLMs for Causal Reasoning)

- Topic Path: [TOPIC] — the current semantic layer (e.g., Methodology or Methodology → LLMs as Reasoning Engines)

- Input: A set of paper IDs and content summaries: [PAPERS]

**Your Tasks**

1. Carefully examine the topic path and understand the expected granularity:

 - If the topic path is broad (e.g., Methodology), your output should be cluster names that describe the role, use, or behavior of LLMs, such as:

  + LLMs as Reasoning Engines
  + LLMs as Planning Assistants
  + LLMs as Helpers to Traditional Methods

 - If the topic path is already specific (e.g., Methodology → LLMs as Reasoning Engines), your cluster names should reflect specific modeling or training strategies, such as:

  + Prompt Engineering
  + Chain-of-Thought Tuning
  + Knowledge-Augmented Fine-Tuning

2. Generate a valid JSON object where:

**Output format (JSON)**:

{
  "Cluster Name": "A clear and specific title (at least 5 words)",
  "Summary": "A concise yet comprehensive summary of the key ideas, methods, and contributions within the collection."
}


⚠️ **Constraints**

 - Cluster Name should be specific, functional, and grounded in the shared patterns of the papers

 - Do not include generic names like “LLM Applications” or “Recent Advances”

 - Maintain strict JSON format

'''
You are an expert in scientific research analysis. 
Your task is to construct a taxonomy of research papers related to the title: [TITLE].

You are provided with input in the form of either a set of research papers or pre-grouped paper clusters, all focusing on the broader topic: [TOPIC].

Your goal is to analyze the collection and identify its most distinctive and unifying characteristics, in order to:

- Extract the dominant themes, functionalities, or usage patterns shared across the items

- Abstract a common concept or usage scenario that best summarizes this group

- Generate a concise but specific cluster name (e.g., LLM with Tools, LLM-Augmented Code Generation, Instruction Tuning for Multi-Agent Systems)

- Provide a comprehensive yet concise summary of the key ideas, representative trends, or technical focus of the papers

For example:

- If the title is [LLMs for Causal Reasoning], and the topic is [Methodology], you need to generate like [LLMs as Reasoning Engines] or [LLMs as Helper to traditional method].

- If the title is [LLMs for Causal Reasoning], and the topic is [Methodology->LLMs as Reasoning Engines], you need to generate like [Fine-tuning] or [Prompt Engineering].


**Special Instructions**:

- Do not focus solely on methodology or problem formulation. Instead, extract representative use cases, shared paradigms, or architectural commonalities across the papers.

- The cluster title should reflect what these papers are collectively about, not merely what they individually do.

- Be precise, avoiding vague or overly broad titles. Titles should contain at least 5 words.

- Maintain scientific accuracy and coherence.

**Output format (JSON)**:

{
  "Cluster Name": "A clear and specific title (at least 5 words)",
  "Summary": "A concise yet comprehensive summary of the key ideas, methods, and contributions within the collection."
}
